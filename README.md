# Introduction
This project will combine SQL and Python in connecting, cleaning and analyzing data to give an idea of how much the hotel have earned (a year-wise comparison of revenue), consider the discounts given to the customers from different market-segments and understand customer behavior in hotel booking and their relationship with hotel cancellation rate. The results of the insights are presented as visual data using Power BI for easier understanding and persuasion.

# Objective
In this project, I explored the business in the hospitality industry. The objective of this analysis is to examine the trend of hotel revenue growth per year and explore the possible relationship between guests and their personal cars to identify any patterns or trends that can be useful in optimizing hotel revenue. The expected outcomes include insights into factors driving hotel revenue growth, identifying areas for improvement, and developing targeted promotions or incentives to optimize revenue growth and improve profitability.

# Data
The data for this reporting is contains contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel starting from January 2018 to August 2020 was taken from kaggle link: 
[Hotel Revenue](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindkrishnadas/hotel-revenue).

Data to support the analysis - [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3).

Note: There is no data from September 2020 which may be because of the COVID 19 pandemic regulations imposed on the country in which the hotels are. 

# Use Case
The project on the analysis and visualization of hotel booking statistics and for building the dashboard using Power BI to present to conditional stakeholders. That can generate enormous insights that could help the hotel management company to outline different strategies and business planning.

Key questions:
1) What is the hotel revenue growth per year?
3) Is there any relation between guest and their personal cars? 
4) Is there any kind of trends/patterns observed in the data?

# Work Environment:
* Tool: Jupyter notebook
* Programming languages: SQL and Python (Pandas, Numpy)
* Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib and Seaborn
